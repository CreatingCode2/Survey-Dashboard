## Important Notes

### Security & Privacy

✅ **No Real Data**: Demo uses 100% fake data generated by script  
✅ **Offline**: Works without internet, no data sent anywhere  
✅ **Safe to Share**: No customer information or proprietary data  

### Limitations

⚠️ **Read-Only**: Changes (CSM assignments, triage status) aren't saved  
⚠️ **Static Data**: Mock data doesn't update automatically  
⚠️ **No Backend**: No Google Sheets integration in demo version  

### Best Practices

1. **Always verify** no real data before sharing
2. **Update mock data** periodically for fresh timestamps
3. **Include README** for technical details
4. **Provide context** about what the demo shows

## Differences from Production

| Feature | Production | Demo |
|---------|-----------|------|
| Data Source | Google Sheets (live) | Local CSV files (static) |
| Data Updates | Real-time | Static mock data |
| Header | "Customer Health Dashboard" | "Customer Health Dashboard DEMO" |
| Internet Required | Yes (for data fetch) | No (fully offline) |
| Data Persistence | Triage changes saved | Changes not saved |

---

## Customizing the Demo

### Regenerate Mock Data

To create fresh mock data with recent timestamps:

```bash
python generate_mock_data.py --responses 75 --months 12
```

See `MOCK_DATA_GUIDE.md` for details.

### Update Branding

To customize for specific prospects:

1. **Edit HTML**: Update company name/logo in `customer_health_dashboard_demo.html`
2. **Edit CSS**: Modify colors in `customer_health_dashboard.css`
3. **Keep DEMO badge**: Always keep the DEMO indicator visible

---

## Hosting on GitHub Pages (Free)

For a live demo URL:

1. **Create GitHub repository** (public or private)
2. **Upload demo files** to repository
3. **Enable GitHub Pages** in repository settings
4. **Share URL**: `https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name/customer_health_dashboard_demo.html`

**Benefits:**
- Free hosting
- Easy updates (just push changes)
- Professional demo URL
- No server management

---

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Shows "Loading..." Forever

**Cause**: Browser can't load local CSV files due to security restrictions

**Solution**:
- Open files from extracted folder (not directly from ZIP)
- Use a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
- If still issues, host files on a web server

### Charts Not Displaying

**Cause**: JavaScript not loading or browser compatibility

**Solution**:
- Ensure all 7 files are in the same folder
- Try a different browser
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Data Looks Wrong

**Cause**: Old mock data or files mixed up

**Solution**:
- Regenerate mock data: `python generate_mock_data.py`
- Verify you're opening `customer_health_dashboard_demo.html` (not the production version)

---

## Feedback & Updates

When sharing demos:
- **Track feedback**: Note what prospects like/dislike
- **Update regularly**: Regenerate mock data quarterly
- **Version control**: Keep demo files in Git for easy updates

---

## Next Steps

After sharing the demo:
1. **Follow up** with recipients to answer questions
2. **Gather feedback** on features and usability
3. **Schedule demo call** if they want to see production version
4. **Provide pricing/implementation** info if interested
